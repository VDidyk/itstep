## About this Repository üöÄ

Welcome to my learning repository! This space is dedicated to my educational journey at IT Step. Here, each piece of work, each experiment, and exploration has its place. You'll find each project nested in its branch, allowing for a clean and organized flow. Don't worry; all branches merge back into the master, ensuring that every bit of progress is captured and readily available.

### Structure üèó

- **Branches:** Each task or project resides in its unique branch.
- **Merging:** All work eventually merges back into the master branch, making it the go-to for an overview of progress.

Feel free to explore, and thank you for visiting!
